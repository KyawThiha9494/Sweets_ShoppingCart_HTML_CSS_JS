# Sweets_ShoppingCart_HTML_CSS_JS
Created a Shopping Cart HTML Page with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Used Atom with HTML Preview. 

HTML is used to create the actual content of the page, such as written text, and CSS (Cascade Styling Sheets) is responsible for the design or style of the website, including the layout, visual effects and background color.

Javascript is for the functionality of the page such as being able to reflect changes in quantity and total price when pressing the buttons like Update Cart or Remove [x] item.
